# Create a Learning Path AI to help you learn new things and to achieve your goals

## What is Learning Path AI?

Learning Path AI is a powerful tool that helps you create mindmaps of your learning goals and tracks your progress as you learn new things. It's designed to help you achieve your goals by providing you with a clear roadmap to follow, and by tracking your progress along the way.

## How does it work?

Learning Path AI uses a combination of AI and human expertise to create mindmaps of your learning goals. It then uses this mindmap to track your progress as you learn new things. The AI helps you create a clear roadmap to follow, while the human expertise helps you stay on track and make adjustments as needed.

## How can I use it?

To use Learning Path AI, you'll need to create a mindmap of your learning goals. This can be done by using the Learning Path AI tool, which is available on the [Learning Path AI website](https://www.learningpathai.com/). Once you've created your mindmap, you can use it to track your progress as you learn new things.
